My Battleship game

Welcome to my project 3 assesment, Python.

In this game, the rules are simple. 
You got 10 turns to find and eliminate the enemy ship.

Failure to hit the enemy will result in Game Loss.

You first make a choice of what row number you want to shot at. The numbers are 1-8.
Then, you pick the line using a letter between A-H, in alphabetic order.

In order to create this, I started with the idea. 
I first thought of something like a inventory app. But since I have always been a gamer, I saw to it to create a game instead.
Now, this was beyond what I had learned, so in order to create something, I had to follow a youtube tutorial. 
Following the tutorial helped me with the structure, but I still have a lot to learn. That is how it goes for every programming language. You can never learn enough.
With a strict deadline, this was unfourtnely my only option.

The game is a simple, but difficult entertanment game.

The Python code was ran through a validator. Link here: https://extendsclass.com/python-tester.html

This program was created alongside a Youtube- tutorial.

Credits to my Mentor for helping me troubleshooting my codes and adding some better visual apperance.

This was a fun but difficult task to complete. But I learned a lot on the way. And knowledge is key.
